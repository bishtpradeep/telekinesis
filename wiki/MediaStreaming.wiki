#summary Media streaming with telekinesis

== Streaming video and audio ==

If you store movie or music files on your computer, you can watch and listen to them on your iPhone using telekinesis after enabling  the feature (see below.) The files have to be supported by the iPhone:

  * H.264 Baseline Profile Level 3.0 video, up to 640 x 480 at 30 fps. 
  * MPEG-4 Part 2 video (Simple Profile)
  * AAC-LC audio, up to 48 kHz
  * .mov, .mp4, .m4v, .3gp file formats
  * Any movies or audio files that can play on an iPod.

Over EDGE you stream media in real time up to 160kbits (in practice 80-100 however.) 

As of now there is no way to stream playlists or queue multiple files.


== Caveats of media streaming ==

The iPhone doesn't appear to accept media encrypted with a self signed certificate. To enable streaming, iPhone Remote is able to send it insecurely. This feature is off by default because of security concerns.


* This allows anyone who can connect to your machine to access m4b, m4v, m4a, mov, and mp3 files if they know the full path to the file*

* Do not enable this unless you are sure your network is secure. *

To enable, in the terminal type:

`defaults write com.blacktree.Telekinesis EnableMediaPort 1`

Then relaunch.
