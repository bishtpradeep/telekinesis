#summary Caveats of media streaming

The iPhone doesn't appear to accept media encrypted with a self signed certificate. To enable streaming, iPhone Remote is able to send it insecurely. This feature is off by default because of security concerns.


* This allows anyone who can connect to your machine to access m4b, m4v, m4a, mov, and mp3 files if they know the full path to the file*

* Do not enable this unless you are sure your network is secure. *

To enable, in the terminal type:

`defaults write com.blacktree.Telekinesis EnableMediaPort 1`

Then relaunch.
