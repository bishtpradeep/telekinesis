#summary How to add functionality to Telekinesis

= Introduction =

Adding functionality to telekinesis is simple, there are two approaches, basic web pages and custom servers.

== Basic Web Page ==

  * Since access to pages will be restricted to the current user and the communications encrypted, you can feel free to blatantly disregard any normal security concerns in web pages. That's the whole point. :)

  * Create a simple web page in html/php, etc and install it in 
   `~/Library/Application Support/Telekinesis/Apps/<App Name>`
  * Give it a custom icon at
   `.../Apps/<App Name>/<App Name>.png`

== Custom Servers ==

For more advanced apps, you may want to provide web content directly.
Currently this isn't supported, but will be soon. 
Telekinesis will support proxying an application directory set up as above to your own application via a plist inside the folder. More information forthcoming.


== Built in functionality ==

The Telekinesis server supports some basic functionality that may be useful in any application:

  * Running Scripts: /t/runscript?path=<absolute path to script> [We need to add relative-to-app-support]
  * Screen capture: /t/grabscreen
  * Move click: /t/click?x=100&y=100
  * Move mouse: /t/mousemove?x=100&y=100
  * File Icons: /t//icon?path=<Absolute path>
