Here is my plan

Running telekinesis sets up a mini webserver on 
https://localhost:5001 accessible only to localhost

It launches apache on:
https://localhost:8080/

Apache publishes:

https://localhost:8080/ from ./Contents/Resources/www
https://localhost:8080/apps/ from ~/Library/App Support/Telekinesis 
https://localhost:8080/t/ is a proxy for the internal app and supports:
	https://localhost:8080/t/?typestring=blah
	https://localhost:8080/t/?click=18,299
	https://localhost:8080/t/?runscript=scripts/pause.scpt
	and others...
